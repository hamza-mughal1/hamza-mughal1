### About

I’m a Backend & AI Systems Engineer with 4+ years of experience designing and shipping scalable, low-latency systems in Python.

My work sits at the intersection of **FastAPI**, **async architectures**, and **AI-driven platforms**. I’ve built real-world systems ranging from real-time voice AI agents to multi-agent automation backends, vector-search-powered RAG pipelines, and ERP-integrated AI services.

I care about clean architecture, observability, and systems that survive real traffic, not demos.

### What I work on

- Production-grade **FastAPI** backends (async-first, testable, scalable)
- **AI agent platforms** with multi-agent orchestration and RAG
- Real-time **voice AI systems** (Twilio, Plivo, low-latency pipelines)
- Vector search, embeddings, long-context retrieval, and summarization
- Backend-heavy automation platforms (workflow engines, schedulers)
- Infrastructure-aware development (Docker, CI/CD, monitoring)

---

### Selected Projects & Experience Highlights

- Built a **real-time voice AI platform** handling 50+ concurrent calls at ~1500ms latency using multi-LLM RAG, streaming pipelines, VAD, and session reuse.
- Architected **multi-agent AI systems** for document processing, service ticketing, ERP automation, and after-hours voice support with 80–90% operational latency reduction.
- Designed and built a **no-code workflow orchestration engine** from scratch with distributed async executors, Redis pub/sub telemetry, sandboxed expression evaluation, and extensible node factories.
- Refactored backend systems with RBAC, caching, and rate limiting, cutting API latency by up to 45%.
- Integrated AI agents into ERP systems (Odoo) for natural-language querying and actionable insights.

### Philosophy

I don’t chase buzzwords.  
I build systems that run, scale, and stay debuggable six months later.
